Safeguards for SuperCollider live coding.

SystemOverwrites are really bad style, so only use this when you
know what you do. These extension tries to catch some possible
crashes while mistyping things.

The extension is currently compatible with SC 3.5.1

Send me a pull request if you want to add some things! I will only
add stuff that really has no purpose.

For example:

[...]!inf really has no purpose at the moment.
inf.do can lead to a crash, but not in a yielded Stream
