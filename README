Safeguards for SuperCollider live coding.

SystemOverwrites are really bad style, so only use this when you
know what you do. This extension tries to catch some possible
crashes while mistyping things, and other stupid stuff.

The extension is currently compatible with SC 3.5.3.
It can make things go bad on other versions.

Send me a pull request if you want to add things! I will only
add stuff that really has no purpose and leads to a crash/hang.

For example:

[...]!inf really has no purpose at the moment. (yes!)
inf.do can lead to a crash, but not in a yielded Stream (no!)
